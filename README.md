# portfolio-optimizer-py, a portfolio optimizer by Alexander Nichols

## Tools used in the creation of this project:
 
> yfinance, PyPortfolioOpt

## Summary:

This is my portfolio optimizer, where with the input of stock tickers (represented by some example tickers in symbols_all and symbols_HC), and other optimization factors (current: Risk Free Rate, Number of Iterations, Risk Free Rate Pertubation, Beta Pertubation, Standard Deviation Pertubation) an investor could get the optimzied portfolio for their stocks. With the addition of a portfolio value integer, an investor can now use that information to get numerical values for the amount of shares to buy for each one of the recommended stocks

Future work includes other optimization techniques (currently using Sharpe Ratio), increasing Pertubation checks, and more!
